# Q1
    - use java stuff that i didn't have time to do on the exam because i didn't remember how to use proper java functions.
    - remove bubble sort, either selection or insertion at minimum ?
    - user proper struct to hold the terms (does java have struct? or need to use classes.)
    - implement a proper lineParsing
    - after we do our proper lineParse, then we need to actually use java inbuilt ones so i can learn.
# Q2
    -- maybe we can try removing the strict checking? and do a heuristic? we don't really need to check all chars.
